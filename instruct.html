    <h1>Instructions for Uploading Fingerprints</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Step 1: Choose How to Capture Your Fingerprints</strong><br>
        1. <strong>Using a Mobile App (Recommended – Most Accurate):</strong> Use a dedicated fingerprint SDK app such as <em>iSL SDK App</em> for mobile devices. This method captures high-quality prints suitable for our analysis.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Install the <strong>iSL SDK App</strong> from the Play Store.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Register yourself within the app.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Navigate to the <strong>Fingerprint Capture</strong> section.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Place your finger on the sensor and capture the fingerprint.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Take a screenshot of the captured fingerprint image.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Upload this screenshot in the corresponding section on the dashboard (ensure the correct finger section is selected).<br><br>

        2. <strong>Using Ink Pad and Paper:</strong> Press your finger on an ink pad and then roll it onto a clean white paper to get a clear print.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 2: Take Clear Pictures</strong><br>
        Make sure the image is sharp and in focus. Ensure good lighting—avoid shadows or bright glare. Capture the whole finger in the picture; it should clearly show the pattern of your fingerprint.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3: Uploading</strong><br>
        Go to the “Upload Fingerprints” section on the dashboard.<br>
        Select your files for each finger. <strong>(Upload the correct fingerprint in every section for accurate results, e.g., upload Right Thumb in Right Thumb section only.)</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Tips:</strong><br>
        - Make sure the finger is centered in the photo.<br>
        - Avoid blurred, smudged, or incomplete prints.<br>
